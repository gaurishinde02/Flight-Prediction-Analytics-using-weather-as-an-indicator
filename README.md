In this case, the Port Authority's Airports Department (PAAD), which oversees operations for JFK and LGA, has commissioned a team of analysts from consultancy, Arthur Samuel Data Insights Ltd, to build a predictive model that can assist with the effective management of flight delays during the winter season. Among the uses for a more effective methodology of predicting flight delays are airport operations optimization, revenue management, customer service improvement, and resource allocation. With a robust model, the PAAD can collaborate with its partners – including supply chain managers (export/import), travel agencies, insurance companies, airport planning authorities, and the tourism/hospitality industry – to create better-synergized processes and contingency plans related to flight disruptions. At minimum, the ability to adjust crew schedules, gate assignments, and aircraft allocations will help minimize disruptions and improve overall efficiency. 

## Datasets 

To build the models, two datasets have been acquired and merged to provide a rich degree of data to feed into the models. First, a dataset with records of the historical flight information for January 2022 for all flights in the US, including detailed information on flight delays. The second dataset provides the weather patterns for the New York City area for January 2022, including rain, fog, snow, and wind speeds. The datasets are merged, so that for every flight that left each airport during January 2022, a comprehensive picture of the weather conditions at the same hour as takeoff can be utilized for analysis and building models.
